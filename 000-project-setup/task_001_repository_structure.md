# TASK-001: Repository Structure Setup

## Task Overview

### Goal
**What to Build:** Create and configure two main repositories (clinic-backend, clinic-portal) with proper documentation, development environment setup, and initial project structure.

**Why:** Establishes the foundational repository structure and development standards for the MedFlow project, enabling efficient team collaboration and standardized development practices.

**Definition of Done:** Both repositories are created with complete setup documentation, proper gitignore files, development tool configuration, and team members can clone and run basic setup within 30 minutes.

### Scope
```yaml
task_type: "INTEGRATION"
complexity: "MEDIUM"
```

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Repository Creation and Structure**
   - Description: Create two separate repositories with standardized folder structure and naming conventions
   - Acceptance Criteria: Both repositories follow naming convention (clinic-backend, clinic-portal) with proper initial structure
   - Priority: HIGH

2. **Development Environment Documentation**
   - Description: Comprehensive README files with setup instructions, dependencies, and development workflow
   - Acceptance Criteria: New developer can follow documentation to set up environment in under 30 minutes
   - Priority: HIGH

3. **Git Configuration and Standards**
   - Description: Proper gitignore files, branch protection rules, and commit message standards
   - Acceptance Criteria: Git hooks and standards prevent common issues and enforce code quality
   - Priority: MEDIUM

### Technical Requirements
```yaml
performance:
  - requirement: "Repository clone and initial setup time"
    target: "< 5 minutes for repository clone and dependency installation"
    
security:
  - requirement: "Secure credential management"
    implementation: "Environment variables for all secrets, no hardcoded credentials"
    
compatibility:
  - requirement: "Cross-platform development support"
    scope: "Windows, macOS, and Linux development environments"
```

## Implementation Details

### Technical Approach
```yaml
repository_structure:
  clinic-backend:
    - README.md
    - .gitignore
    - .env.example
    - package.json
    - tsconfig.json
    - .eslintrc.js
    - .prettierrc
    - docker-compose.yml (for local development)
    - src/ (placeholder structure)
    
  clinic-portal:
    - README.md
    - .gitignore
    - .env.example
    - package.json
    - tsconfig.json
    - .eslintrc.js
    - .prettierrc
    - vite.config.ts
    - src/ (placeholder structure)
    
  deployment:
    - docker/
    - docker-compose.yml
    - config/ (dev, staging, prod folders)
    - scripts/

development_tools:
  - tool: "ESLint configuration"
    purpose: "Code quality and consistency"
    setup: "Shared configuration across repositories"
    
  - tool: "Prettier configuration"
    purpose: "Code formatting standardization"
    setup: "Consistent formatting rules"
```

### Integration Points
```yaml
dependencies:
  - dependency: "GitHub repository access"
    type: "SERVICE"
    status: "AVAILABLE"
    note: use github cli.
    
provides:
  - deliverable: "Standardized repository structure"
    interface: "Git repositories with documentation"
    consumers: "All development team members"
    
  - deliverable: "Development environment standards"
    interface: "Configuration files and documentation"
    consumers: "Backend, frontend, and infrastructure development"
```

### Code Patterns to Follow

**Repository Naming Conventions:**
- Use lowercase with hyphens for repository names
- Prefix with project name for clarity (clinic-backend, clinic-portal)
- Follow consistent naming across all repositories

**Documentation Standards:**
- README.md must include: Project description, prerequisites, setup instructions, development workflow, deployment instructions
- Use markdown formatting with proper headers and code blocks, no emoji use
- Document all environment variables and configuration options

**Git Configuration:**
- Implement branch protection for main/master branch (if possible)
- Require pull requests for all changes (if possible)
- Use conventional commit message format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage
```yaml
integration_tests:
  - focus: "Repository setup and cloning process"
  - test_environment: "Fresh development machines"
  - key_flows: ["repository_clone", "dependency_installation", "development_server_start"]
  
documentation_tests:
  - focus: "Setup documentation accuracy"
  - test_environment: "Multiple operating systems"
  - key_flows: ["new_developer_onboarding", "environment_setup"]
```

### Test Scenarios
```yaml
happy_path:
  - scenario: "New developer setup"
    steps: ["Clone repository", "Install dependencies", "Start development server"]
    expected_result: "Development environment running within 30 minutes"
    
error_cases:
  - scenario: "Missing prerequisites"
    trigger: "Node.js or required tools not installed"
    expected_behavior: "Clear error messages with installation instructions"
    
edge_cases:
  - scenario: "Network connectivity issues"
    conditions: "Slow or intermittent internet connection"
    expected_behavior: "Graceful handling with retry mechanisms"
```
