# TASK-002: Terraform Infrastructure Base

## Task Overview

### Goal
**What to Build:** Create foundational AWS infrastructure using Terraform modules for VPC, security groups, and basic networking components that will support the MedFlow healthcare management system.

**Why:** Establishes secure, scalable, and cost-effective cloud infrastructure foundation that can be consistently deployed across development, staging, and production environments.

**Definition of Done:** Terraform infrastructure can provision and destroy AWS resources reliably, with proper security configurations and environment separation.

### Scope
```yaml
task_type: "BACKEND"
complexity: "HIGH"
```

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **VPC and Networking Infrastructure**
   - Description: Create Virtual Private Cloud with public/private subnets across multiple availability zones
   - Acceptance Criteria: VPC with proper CIDR blocks, subnets, internet gateway, and NAT gateways configured
   - Priority: HIGH

2. **Security Groups Configuration**
   - Description: Define security groups for web tier, application tier, and database tier with minimal required access
   - Acceptance Criteria: Security groups follow least privilege principle with documented access rules
   - Priority: HIGH

3. **Multi-Environment Support**
   - Description: Support for dev, staging, and production environments with parameterized configurations
   - Acceptance Criteria: Each environment can be deployed independently with appropriate resource sizing
   - Priority: MEDIUM

### Technical Requirements
```yaml
performance:
  - requirement: "Infrastructure provisioning time"
    target: "< 15 minutes for complete environment setup"
    
security:
  - requirement: "Network isolation and security"
    implementation: "Private subnets for databases, security groups with minimal access"
    
compatibility:
  - requirement: "Multi-region deployment capability"
    scope: "Primary deployment in eu-west-1 (Ireland) for Algerian market proximity"
```

## Implementation Details

### Technical Approach
```yaml
terraform_modules:
  vpc:
    - main.tf (VPC, subnets, gateways)
    - variables.tf (input parameters)
    - outputs.tf (VPC ID, subnet IDs, etc.)
    
  security-groups:
    - main.tf (security group definitions)
    - variables.tf (port configurations)
    - outputs.tf (security group IDs)
    
  networking:
    - main.tf (route tables, NACLs)
    - variables.tf (routing configurations)
    - outputs.tf (route table IDs)

environment_structure:
  environments/dev:
    - main.tf (environment-specific resources)
    - variables.tf (dev-specific parameters)
    - terraform.tfvars (dev values)
    
  environments/staging:
    - main.tf (staging-specific resources)
    - variables.tf (staging parameters)
    - terraform.tfvars (staging values)
    
  environments/prod:
    - main.tf (production resources)
    - variables.tf (production parameters)
    - terraform.tfvars (production values)
```

### Integration Points
```yaml
dependencies:
  - dependency: "AWS account with appropriate permissions"
    type: "SERVICE"
    status: "AVAILABLE"
    
  - dependency: "Terraform Cloud or S3 backend for state management"
    type: "SERVICE"
    status: "PLANNED"
    
provides:
  - deliverable: "VPC infrastructure"
    interface: "VPC ID, subnet IDs, security group IDs"
    consumers: "Database, application, and web tier deployments"
    
  - deliverable: "Security configurations"
    interface: "Security group rules and network ACLs"
    consumers: "All AWS services requiring network access"
```

### Code Patterns to Follow

**Terraform Module Organization:**
- One module per logical infrastructure component
- Use descriptive variable names with proper descriptions
- Include validation blocks for critical parameters
- Follow HashiCorp's module standards

**Resource Naming Convention:**
```hcl
# Pattern: {environment}-{project}-{resource-type}-{description}
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = var.vpc_cidr
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "${var.environment}-medflow-vpc"
    Environment = var.environment
    Project     = "medflow"
    ManagedBy   = "terraform"
  }
}
```

**Security Best Practices:**
- Use least privilege principle for all security groups
- Enable VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring
- Implement proper subnet segregation (public/private/database)
- Use consistent tagging strategy for resource management

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage
```yaml
infrastructure_tests:
  - focus: "Terraform plan and apply execution"
  - test_environment: "Isolated AWS accounts"
  - key_scenarios: ["plan_generation", "resource_creation", "resource_destruction"]
  
security_tests:
  - focus: "Security group rules and network access"
  - test_environment: "Test VPC deployment"
  - key_scenarios: ["network_isolation", "security_group_rules", "public_access_restrictions"]
```

### Test Scenarios
```yaml
happy_path:
  - scenario: "Complete infrastructure deployment"
    steps: ["terraform init", "terraform plan", "terraform apply"]
    expected_result: "All resources created without errors"
    
error_cases:
  - scenario: "Invalid CIDR block configuration"
    trigger: "Overlapping CIDR blocks or invalid ranges"
    expected_behavior: "Terraform validation error with clear message"
    
edge_cases:
  - scenario: "Resource limit exceeded"
    conditions: "AWS account limits reached"
    expected_behavior: "Graceful failure with actionable error message"
```
