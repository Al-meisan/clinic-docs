# TASK-015: CI/CD Pipeline Setup

## Task Overview

### Goal
**What to Build:** Create comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, security scanning, and deployment automation with healthcare-specific compliance and quality gates.

**Why:** Ensures consistent code quality, automates deployment processes, provides rapid feedback on code changes, and maintains high reliability standards essential for healthcare applications through automated validation and deployment.

**Definition of Done:** Complete CI/CD pipeline operational with automated testing, security scanning, build processes, and deployment workflows for development, staging, and production environments.

### Scope
```yaml
task_type: "DEVOPS"
complexity: "HIGH"
```

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Automated Testing Pipeline**
   - Description: Complete test automation including unit tests, integration tests, and code quality validation
   - Acceptance Criteria: All tests run automatically on pull requests, comprehensive test reporting, and quality gates enforcement
   - Priority: HIGH

2. **Build and Deployment Automation**
   - Description: Automated build processes for frontend and backend with environment-specific deployments
   - Acceptance Criteria: Consistent builds across environments, automated deployment to AWS, and rollback capabilities
   - Priority: HIGH

3. **Security and Compliance Scanning**
   - Description: Automated security vulnerability scanning, dependency auditing, and healthcare compliance checks
   - Acceptance Criteria: Security issues detected and reported, compliance validation automated, and blocking of insecure deployments
   - Priority: HIGH

4. **Multi-Environment Pipeline**
   - Description: Separate pipelines for development, staging, and production with appropriate approval workflows
   - Acceptance Criteria: Environment-specific configurations, manual approvals for production, and proper environment isolation
   - Priority: MEDIUM

### Technical Requirements
```yaml
performance:
  - requirement: "Pipeline execution time"
    target: "reasonable time for complete pipeline including tests and deployment"
    
security:
  - requirement: "Healthcare compliance validation"
    implementation: "Automated healthcare privacy compliance checks and security vulnerability scanning"
    
reliability:
  - requirement: "Pipeline success rate"
    target: "> 95% success rate for valid code changes"
```

## Implementation Details

### Technical Approach
```yaml
cicd_architecture:
  github_actions:
    - workflow_triggers: "Pull requests, pushes to main, manual deployment triggers"
    - parallel_execution: "Tests and builds run in parallel for efficiency"
    - matrix_strategy: "Multiple Node.js versions and environments"
    - caching_strategy: "Dependencies and build artifacts cached for performance"
    
  pipeline_stages:
    - code_quality: "Linting, formatting, type checking"
    - testing: "Unit tests, integration tests, e2e tests"
    - security_scanning: "Vulnerability scanning, dependency audit"
    - building: "Frontend and backend build processes"
    - deployment: "Environment-specific deployment automation"
    - monitoring: "Post-deployment health checks"
    
  deployment_strategy:
    - infrastructure: "Terraform-managed AWS infrastructure"
    - container_deployment: "Docker containers via AWS ECS"
    - database_migrations: "Automated database schema updates"
    - health_checks: "Application health validation post-deployment"

healthcare_compliance:
  security_requirements:
    - vulnerability_scanning: "OWASP dependency check and Snyk scanning"
    - code_security: "Static analysis security testing (SAST)"
    - audit_logging: "Complete audit trail of all pipeline activities"
    
  quality_gates:
    - test_coverage: "Minimum 80% code coverage enforcement"
    - security_approval: "No high-severity vulnerabilities allowed"
```

### Integration Points
```yaml
dependencies:
  - dependency: "GitHub repository with proper structure"
    type: "SOURCE_CONTROL"
    status: "AVAILABLE"
    
  - dependency: "AWS infrastructure with deployment targets"
    type: "INFRASTRUCTURE"
    status: "IN_PROGRESS"
    
  - dependency: "Development environment with quality tools"
    type: "DEVELOPMENT"
    status: "IN_PROGRESS"
    
provides:
  - deliverable: "Automated CI/CD pipeline"
    interface: "GitHub Actions workflows for testing and deployment"
    consumers: "Development team and deployment processes"
    
  - deliverable: "Quality assurance automation"
    interface: "Automated testing, security scanning, and compliance validation"
    consumers: "Code quality assurance and security compliance"
    
  - deliverable: "Deployment automation"
    interface: "Environment-specific deployment workflows"
    consumers: "AWS infrastructure and application hosting"
```

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage
```yaml
pipeline_tests:
  - focus: "CI/CD pipeline functionality and reliability"
  - coverage_target: "100% of pipeline stages tested"
  - key_scenarios: ["successful_deployment", "failed_deployment_rollback", "security_gate_enforcement"]
  
integration_tests:
  - focus: "Pipeline integration with AWS services"
  - test_environment: "Isolated test AWS account"
  - key_flows: ["infrastructure_deployment", "application_deployment", "health_checks"]
  
security_tests:
  - focus: "Pipeline security and compliance validation"
  - test_environment: "Security scanning tools and test repositories"
  - key_scenarios: ["vulnerability_detection", "compliance_validation", "access_control"]
```

### Test Scenarios
```yaml
happy_path:
  - scenario: "Complete CI/CD pipeline execution"
    steps: ["Code commit", "Automated testing", "Security scanning", "Build", "Deploy to staging", "Health check"]
    expected_result: "Successful deployment with all quality gates passed"
    
error_cases:
  - scenario: "Security vulnerability detected"
    trigger: "Code with high-severity security vulnerabilities"
    expected_behavior: "Pipeline halts, security report generated, deployment blocked"
    
  - scenario: "Failed deployment"
    trigger: "Deployment failure or health check failure"
    expected_behavior: "Automatic rollback initiated, team notified, investigation triggered"
    
edge_cases:
  - scenario: "Infrastructure drift detection"
    conditions: "Manual changes made to production infrastructure"
    expected_behavior: "Drift detected, reconciliation process initiated, alerts sent"
```

## Context References

### From Project
```yaml
tech_stack_references:
  - "GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation"

architecture_patterns:
  - "Infrastructure as Code with Terraform"
  - "Containerized application deployment"
  - "Multi-environment deployment strategy"
  - "Security-first DevOps practices"
  
code_standards:
  - "Automated quality gate enforcement"
  - "Security scanning and compliance validation"
  - "Healthcare-specific compliance checks"
  - "Comprehensive testing and validation"
```

### From Epic
```yaml
business_rules:
  - "Healthcare applications require rigorous testing and compliance validation"
  - "Production deployments require manual approval for patient safety"
  - "Security vulnerabilities must block deployments"
  - "Audit trail required for all deployment activities"
  
integration_points:
  - "Integrates with all development and infrastructure components"
  - "Required for production-ready application deployment"
  - "Foundation for continuous delivery and quality assurance"
```
